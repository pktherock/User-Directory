# User Directory App

## Features

- API Handling
- How to use React router dom
- How to open model without any library
- Custom hook for fetching data (API calls)
- Context API to store data which is not going to be change (as we are using free api)
- Show clock according to timezone

## To Start Project locally

- Clone this repo
- install all dependencies (npm install or npm i)
- npm run dev (to start development server)
- follow the url in terminal

Note: Currently We have latitude and longitude with all users but we don't have api for now(requires api key) to call, and get timezone based on latitude and longitude, if we do that we can show easily time user's location time.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
